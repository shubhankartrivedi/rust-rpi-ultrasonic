Certainly! Here's the same explanation of the code with insights on how the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor works:

### How the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Works:

The HC-SR04 sensor determines the distance to an object by emitting an ultrasonic sound wave at a frequency of 40 kHz, then waiting for that sound wave to bounce back. The sensor has two main components:

1. **Trigger (TRIG) Pin**:
   - The trigger pin sends a brief high pulse to initiate the measurement.

2. **Echo (ECHO) Pin**:
   - The echo pin goes high while the ultrasonic pulse is traveling to and from the object.
   - The duration of the echo pin being high represents the time taken for the sound wave to travel to the object and back.

The time it takes for the sound wave to travel out and back can be used to calculate the distance to the object. The formula is:

\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{\text{Time} \times \text{Speed of Sound}}{2} \]

Now, onto the code:

```rust
use rppal::gpio::{Gpio};
use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
```

1. **Imports**:
   - We start by importing the necessary modules:
   - `rppal` (Raspberry Pi Peripheral Access Library) for GPIO control.
   - `sleep` from the standard thread module to pause the program.
   - `Duration` and `Instant` from the standard time module to manage timing.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Constants
    const GPIO_TRIG: u8 = 11;
    const GPIO_ECHO: u8 = 18;
    const SOUND_SPEED: f64 = 34300.0; // in cm/s
    const TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_secs(1);
    const DELAY_BETWEEN_MEASUREMENTS: Duration = Duration::from_secs(1);
```

2. **Constants**:
   - `GPIO_TRIG` and `GPIO_ECHO` are set to the GPIO pin numbers where the sensor is connected.
   - `SOUND_SPEED` is set to the speed of sound in air, which is approximately 34300 cm/s.
   - `TIMEOUT` is set to 1 second, representing the maximum time to wait for a signal.
   - `DELAY_BETWEEN_MEASUREMENTS` is set to 1 second, representing the delay between each measurement.

```rust
    // Setup GPIO
    let gpio = Gpio::new().expect("Failed to initialize GPIO");
    let mut trig = gpio.get(GPIO_TRIG).unwrap().into_output();
    let echo = gpio.get(GPIO_ECHO).unwrap().into_input();
```

3. **Setup**:
   - The GPIO is initialized using `Gpio::new()`.
   - The `trig` pin is set as an output, while the `echo` pin is set as an input.
   - The trigger pin will send out the ultrasonic wave, and the echo pin will read the reflected wave.

```rust
    loop {
        // Trigger the sensor
        trig.set_low();
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(2));
        trig.set_high();
        sleep(Duration::from_micros(10));
        trig.set_low();
```

4. **Triggering**:
   - The `trig` pin is initially set to low.
   - After a brief delay of 2 milliseconds (`sleep(Duration::from_millis(2))`), the `trig` pin is set to high for 10 microseconds (`sleep(Duration::from_micros(10))`).
   - This sequence initiates an ultrasonic pulse from the sensor.

```rust
        // Wait for the echo start
        let mut start_time = Instant::now();
        let mut timeout_time = start_time + TIMEOUT;

        while !echo.is_high() {
            if Instant::now() > timeout_time {
                println!("Echo signal timed out on waiting for rising edge");
                break;
            }
        }

        start_time = Instant::now();
        timeout_time = start_time + TIMEOUT;
```

5. **Echo Start**:
   - After triggering the sensor, the code waits for the echo pin to go high (`while !echo.is_high()`).
   - `Instant::now()` is used to record the current time.
   - If the echo pin doesn't go high within the timeout period, the code prints a timeout message and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Echo End**:
   - The code then waits for the echo pin to go low (`while echo.is_high()`).
   - If the echo pin doesn't go low within the timeout period, the code prints a timeout message and breaks out of the loop.

```rust
        let pulse_duration = start_time.elapsed().as_secs_f64();
        let distance = pulse_duration * SOUND_SPEED / 2.0;
```

7. **Calculate Distance**:
   - The time taken for the echo is measured (`pulse_duration`).
   - The distance is calculated using the formula mentioned earlier.

```rust
        // Print the distance
        println!("Distance: {:.2} cm", distance);
        sleep(DELAY_BETWEEN_MEASUREMENTS);
    }
}
```

8. **Output and Loop**:
   - The calculated distance is printed to the console.
   - The code then waits for `DELAY_BETWEEN_MEASUREMENTS` before repeating the loop.
   - The loop allows the program to continually measure and display the distance.
